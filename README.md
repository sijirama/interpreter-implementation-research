i don't know how to build a programming language

# Programming Language Development Plan

## Phase 1: July - September 2024 (Research and Learning)

### July: Introduction and Basics
#### Week 1-2
- **Reading and Tutorials**:
  - "Crafting Interpreters" by Bob Nystrom (start with the basics).
  - "Writing An Interpreter In Go" by Thorsten Ball (concepts applicable in C++).
- **Hands-On**:
  - Build a simple REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) for basic arithmetic expressions.

#### Week 3-4
- **Lexer Implementation**:
  - Tokenize simple source code into basic tokens (identifiers, numbers, operators).
- **AST and Parsing**:
  - Build a basic parser to convert tokens into an AST.

### August: Intermediate Concepts
#### Week 1-2
- **Parsing Techniques**:
  - Study recursive descent and other parsing techniques.
  - Enhance your parser to handle more complex expressions and statements.

#### Week 3-4
- **Semantic Analysis**:
  - Implement a symbol table to track variable declarations and scopes.
  - Add semantic checks to your parser to validate code correctness.

### September: Advanced Topics and Optimization
#### Week 1-2
- **Memory Management**:
  - Study different memory management techniques.
  - Implement a simple mark-and-sweep garbage collector in a prototype.

#### Week 3-4
- **Interpreter Optimizations**:
  - Learn about optimizations like constant folding, inlining, and dead code elimination.
  - Implement a simple VM or bytecode interpreter and optimize it.

## Phase 2: October 2024 - March 2025 (Main Language Development)

### October - December 2024: Language Design and Initial Implementation
#### October
- **Design Finalization**:
  - Finalize syntax and feature set.
  - Set up project structure and repository.
- **Lexer and Parser Implementation**:
  - Write lexer and parser for your language.
  - Implement AST and basic semantic checks.

#### November
- **Parser and Interpreter**:
  - Implement the AST and semantic analysis.
  - Start working on the interpreter.

#### December
- **Runtime and Testing**:
  - Implement basic runtime environment and standard library functions.
  - Begin testing and refining the interpreter.

### January - March 2025: Advanced Features and Optimization
#### January
- **Advanced Features**:
  - Implement functions, loops, and conditionals.
  - Add error handling and debugging support.

#### February
- **Optimization**:
  - Focus on performance optimizations.
  - Add more standard library functions and utilities.

#### March
- **Testing and Documentation**:
  - Conduct thorough testing and debugging.
  - Prepare documentation and tutorials for your language.
  - Engage with the community for feedback and initial user testing.
